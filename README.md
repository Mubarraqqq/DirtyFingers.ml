# DirtyFingers.ml

##### So basically, I would be uploading all my previous ML notebook files (mini-project) from the traditional supervised learning all the way to deeplearning. Might take just a little time, but please be patient with me.

- In the course of learning new concepts over the years, I have also had get my hand dirty while doing so. The problem is/was I have heldback a bit in sharing my works for reasons obscure to me 
- This is where [dirty fingers.ml](https://github.com/Mubarraqqq/DirtyFingers.ml) comes in.
